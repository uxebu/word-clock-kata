# Word Clock Kata
When I walked through the city of Konstanz last night I saw an amazing clock
hanging on a wall, which actually looked like a painting with the words
"it's five till five" (in german) ... when I read it I thought: cool looks
like a clock ... oh, it is a clock :).
Today when sitting on the bus with @0xPIT we looked through pages like
https://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/Word_Clock where you can also see some
pics of what the clock looks like. And then the kata-rush set in and we
built what is the initial commit in this repo.

Have fun doing this kata in any language or however you like.
